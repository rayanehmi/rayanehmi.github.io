This website is almost entirely vibe-coded by Gemini. And yes, it's a single HTML file and the commits make no sense. It just works tho :D

The base directive was for Gemini 2.5 Pro to make a retro video game / zelda style personal website. I then iterated until I was happy with publishing it. There is still a lot to do!
